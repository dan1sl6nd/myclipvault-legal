## Troubleshooting

### Clipboard Not Saving

**Problem**: Items I copy aren't appearing in MyClipVault

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Permissions**: Go to Settings > MyClipVault and ensure all permissions are granted
2. **Restart the App**: Close MyClipVault completely and reopen it
3. **Check Storage**: Ensure your device has available storage space
4. **Update iOS**: Make sure you're running the latest iOS version
5. **Reinstall**: As a last resort, delete and reinstall the app (note: this will erase your local clipboard history)

### Search Not Working

**Problem**: Search isn't finding items I know I copied

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Spelling**: Verify you're spelling the search term correctly
2. **Try Partial Search**: Search for part of the word instead of the full phrase
3. **Check Filters**: Make sure you haven't applied a filter that excludes the item
4. **Refresh**: Pull down on the list to refresh

### App Crashing

**Problem**: MyClipVault crashes or freezes

**Solutions**:
1. **Force Close**: Swipe up from the app switcher to force close, then reopen
2. **Restart Device**: Turn your iPhone/iPad off and on again

4. **Clear Cache**: If the problem persists, try reinstalling the app
5. **Report**: Contact support with your device model and iOS version

### Purchase Not Restoring

**Problem**: "Restore Purchase" isn't working

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Apple ID**: Make sure you're signed in with the same Apple ID used for purchase
2. **Check Internet**: Ensure you have an active internet connection
3. **Wait and Retry**: Sometimes it takes a moment; wait 30 seconds and try again
4. **Check Purchase History**: Go to App Store > Account > Purchase History to verify the purchase
5. **Contact Support**: If still not working, email us with your purchase receipt

### Content Not Detecting Properly

**Problem**: Phone numbers, emails, or URLs aren't being detected

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Format**: Ensure the content is in a standard format (e.g., "email@example.com")
